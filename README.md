# NCAAStatScraper
Simple script for extracting historical NCAA Basketball stats from sports-reference.com. I hacked it together for a Machine Learning project, but if you decide to use please make sure you limit your requests to something human-scale (as-implemented it sleeps 30s for every two requests)

You may need to install *lxml* and *requests* via pip.
